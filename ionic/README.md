if reinstalling from older version of the project, I recommend completely removing  
everything and starting over, including the ```node_modules``` directory  

## Compile for web app

from this ionic directory type:

### Option 1 (Auto-rebuilding)
```
ionic serve
quit
```

### Option 2 (1 time building - May need `npm install -g cordova`)
```
ionic build browser
```

replace the repo build directory with the newly compiled files
from the repo root directory type:

```
rm -rf build  
cp -r ionic/www/build .
```

and then merge this master branch into the ```gh-pages``` branch

## Compile for mobile app via IonicView

from the ionic directory type:

```
ionic upload
```

if you are prompted for username and password, use these values:

```

## TODO:

* register app with android market
* register app with apples store
* automate the ```ionic serve``` build process and web page file copy steps
